The infinity mirror displays hands of an analog wall clock by using an infinite reflection of LEDs to represent the hand positions of a wall clock. To display time red LEDs indicate the hour, green LEDs indicate the minutes, and blue LEDs indicate the seconds. The display is built in a slim cylindrical enclosure with a fully reflective mirror on the inside and a semi reflective mirror on the outside towards the viewer. There are two strips of LEDs lined on the inside wall of the ring. We designed the 3D enclosure using (insert software name), then used the 3D printers in the Engineering Student Design Center located at UC Davis' Bainer Hall.
