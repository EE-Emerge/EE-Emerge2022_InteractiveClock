title: Lixie Clock
description: The Lixie clock draws heavy inspiration from retro-style Nixie tubes, but the design uses low-voltage LEDs as illumination rather than the quite dangerous, high-voltage filaments used in Nixie tubes. The LEDs light etched arylic panes from the underside according to the current time.

Purpose of module is xxxx. 
### Issues
During assembly and testing, we found that there were slight mismatches among the sizes of the Digit and LED boards. While we were able to work around these tolerances, our updates to these PCBs will allow for a better fit. The pin headers that connected the two boards together were also updated to the larger 1 mil pitch for easier wiring. The last issue to be updated is our connection between each of the Lixie modules. The method of connection between each module has been updated so that an ethernet-like cable will be used, providing a robust connection to the modules.
