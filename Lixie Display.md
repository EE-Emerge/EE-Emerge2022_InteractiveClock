Lixie Display is a depiction of digital clock. In this project, six lixie modules are made. Each pair representing hour, minute, and second. Six sets of acrylic signs are engraved with numbers from zero to nine. 

The enclosure is designed and 3D-printed. The design focuses on housing the PCB and creating ten slots to insert the acrylics on top of the enclosure. The vertical small gap is left on the back of the enclosure for cable management and easier closure of the lid. 

There are two PCBs housed inside each Lixie Display module. One of them is the LED PCB. It is equipped with 50 LEDs in the shape of five by ten matrix. The other PCB is equipped with MSP430 micro controller. It receives signals from the main unit and light up LEDs according to their purposes.
