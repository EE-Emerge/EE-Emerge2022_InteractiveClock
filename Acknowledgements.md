We want to give special thanks to our course instructor, Professor Andre Knoesen, and teaching assistant, Sean Alling. We could not have completed this project without their guidance, and we greatly appreciate their support throughout EE-Emerge. We also want to express our gratitude to Texas Instruments and SiTime who provided key componentry for our project.
