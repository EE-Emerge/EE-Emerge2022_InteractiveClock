The project, “Interactive Clock,” presents two methods for displaying time:one analog and one digital. The analog clock displays time by lighting three LEDs in the corresponding positions of the hours, minutes and seconds instead of using traditional clock hands. Its front display has a semi-reflective mirror, whereas the back of the clock has a fully reflective mirror. This causes light to reflect back and forth in the clock, creating an illusion of light extending infinitely. The digital clock takes inspiration from Nixie vacuum tube. Vacuum tubes use high voltage and noble gas to display number-shaped filaments inside tubes using a glow discharge. However, the Lixie clock uses low-voltage driver LED and light scattering to achieve similar affect to Nixie tube display.
